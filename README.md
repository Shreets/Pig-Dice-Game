# Pig-Dice-Game

Javascript based multiplayer dice game where the one who rolls dice upto 100 points first wins. 
The catch is that the points roll back to 0 when dice is rolled to 1. 
However, there is a hold option to secure the points and update them on scoreboard so that they donâ€™t roll back when dice face shows 1.
